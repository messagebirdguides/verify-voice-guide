# Account Security with Voice 
### ‚è± 15 min build time 

## Why build voice-based account security?

Websites where users can sign up for an account typically use the email address as a unique identifier and a password as a security credential for users to sign in. At the same time, most websites ask users to add a verified phone number to their profile. Phone numbers are, in general, a better way to identify an account holder as a real person. They can also be used as a second authentication factor (2FA) or to restore access to a locked account.

Verification of a phone number is straightforward:
1. Ask your user to enter their number.
2. Call the number programmatically and use a text-to-speech system to say a security code that acts as a one-time-password (OTP).
3. Let the user enter this code on the website or inside an application as proof that they received the call.

The MessageBird Verify API assists developers in implementing this workflow into their apps. Imagine you're running a social network and want to verify your member's profiles. This MessageBird Developer Guide shows you an example of a Node.js application with integrated account security following the steps outlined above.

By the way, it is also possible to replace the second step with an SMS message, as we explain the this [two factor authentication guide](https://developers.messagebird.com/guides/verify). However, using voice for verification has the advantage that it works with every phone number, not just mobile phones, so it can be used to verify, for example, the landline of a business. The [MessageBird Verify API](https://developers.messagebird.com/docs/verify) supports both options; voice and SMS.

## Getting Started

The sample application we're about to build is built in Node.js using the [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) framework. You can download or clone the complete source code from the [MessageBird Developer Guides GitHub repository](https://github.com/messagebirdguides/verify-voice-guide) to run the application on your computer and follow along with the guide. To run the sample, you need to have Node and npm set up, which you can [install from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Let's now open the directory where you've stored the sample code and run the following command to install the [MessageBird SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/messagebird) and other dependencies:

````bash
npm install
````

## Configuring the MessageBird SDK

The MessageBird SDK is defined in `package.json`:

````javascript
{
    // [...]
    "dependencies": {
        // [...]
        "messagebird": "^2.1.4"
    },
    // [...]
}
````

It's loaded with a statement at the top of `index.js`:

````javascript
// Load and initialize MesageBird SDK
var messagebird = require('messagebird')(process.env.MESSAGEBIRD_API_KEY);
````

You need to provide a MessageBird API key via an environment variable loaded with [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv). We've prepared an `env.example` file in the repository, which you should rename to `.env` and add the required information. Here's an example:

````env
MESSAGEBIRD_API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEY
````

You can create or retrieve a live API key from the [API access (REST) tab](https://dashboard.messagebird.com/en/developers/access) in the _Developers_ section of your MessageBird account.

## Asking for the Phone number

The sample application contains a form to collect the user's phone number. You can see the HTML as a Handlebars template in the file `views/start.handlebars` and the route that renders it is `get('/')`. All Handlebars files use the layout stored in `views/layouts/main.handlebars` to follow a common structure.

The HTML form includes a `<select>` element as a drop-down to choose the country. That allows users to enter their phone number without the country code. In production applications, you could use this to limit access on a country level and preselect the user's current country by IP address. The form field for the number is a simple `<input>` with the `type` set to `tel` to inform compatible browsers that this is an input field for telephone numbers. Finally, there's a submit button. Once the user clicks on that button, the input is sent to the `/verify` route.

## Initiating the Verification Call

When the user submits their submit, the `post('/verify')` routes takes over. The Verify API expects the user's telephone number to be in international format, so the first step is reading the input and concatenating the country code and the number. If the user enters their local number with a leading zero, we remove this digit.

````javascript
app.post('/verify', function(req, res) {
    // Compose number from country code and number
    var number = req.body.country_code
        + (req.body.phone_number[0] == '0'
            ? req.body.phone_number.substring(1)
            : req.body.phone_number);
````

Next, we can call `verify.create()` on the MessageBird SDK. That launches the API request that initiates the verification call.

````javascript
    // Create verification request with MessageBird Verify API
    messagebird.verify.create(number, {
        type : 'tts', // TTS = text-to-speech, otherwise API defaults to SMS
        template : "Your account security code is %token."
    }, function(err, response) {
````

The method call takes two parameters, the first one is the telephone number that we want to verify and the second is a Javascript hash with configuration options. Our sample application sets two options:
- The `type` is set to `tts` to inform the API that we want to use a voice call for verification.
- The `template` contains the words to speak. It must include the placeholder `%token` so that MessageBird knows where the code goes (note that we use the words token and code interchangeably, they mean the same thing). We don't have to generate this numeric code ourselves; the API takes care of it.

There are a few other available options. For example, you can change the length of the code (it defaults to 6) with `tokenLength`. You can also specify `voice` as `male` or `female` and set the `language` to an ISO language code if you want the synthesized voice to be in a non-English language. You can find more details about these and other options in the [Verify API reference documentation](https://developers.messagebird.com/docs/verify#request-a-verify).

Requests in the MessageBird SDK are asynchronous and require a callback function. This callback function receives two parameters, `err` and `response`. Only one of those parameters has a value; `err` in case of failures and `response` in case of successful execution.

````javascript
    }, function(err, response) {
        if (err) {
            // Something went wrong
            console.log(err);
            res.render('start.handlebars',
                { error : "Could not initiate call." });
        } else {
            // API request was successful, call is on its way
            console.log(response);
            res.render('verify.handlebars', {
                id : response.id // We need this ID to confirm verification.
            });
        }
    });
````

If there was an error, we show the same page to the user as before but add an error parameter which the template displays as a message above the form to notify the user. In the success case, we render a new template. We add the `id` attribute of the API response to this template because we need the identification of our verification request in the next step to confirm the code. In both cases, we also log the raw output to assist with debugging in case something goes awry.

## Confirming the Code

The template stored in `views/verify.handlebars`, which we render in the success case, contains an HTML form with a hidden input field to pass forward the `id` from the verification request. It also contains a regular `<input>` with `type` set to `text` so that the user can enter the code that they've heard on the phone. When the user submits this form, it sends this token to the `/confirm` route.

Inside this route, we call another method on the MessageBird SDK, `verify.verify()` and provide the ID and token as two parameters.

````javascript
app.post('/confirm', function(req, res) {
    // Complete verification request with MessageBird Verify API
    messagebird.verify.verify(req.body.id, req.body.token,
````

Just as before, the responsibility for handling the response goes to a callback function with `err` and `response` parameters.

````javascript
        function(err, response) {
            if (err) {
                // Something went wrong
                console.log(err);
                res.render('start.handlebars',
                    { error : "Verification has failed. Please try again." });
            } else {
                // Confirmation was successful
                console.log(response);
                res.render('confirm.handlebars');
            }
        });
````

We inform the user about the status of the verification by showing either a new success response which is stored in `views/confirm.handlebars`, or showing the first page again with an error message. In production applications, you would use the success case to update your user's phone number as verified in your database.

## Testing the Application

Great, you've reached the end of this guide! This is all you have to do to verify a phone number! Let's test whether your application works. Check again that you have provided a working API key in `.env`. Then, enter the following command in your console:

````bash
npm start
````

Open your browser to http://localhost:8080/ and walk through the process yourself!

## Nice work!
